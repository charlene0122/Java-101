/**
 * About the Game
 * This game needs two players and we will just play the user versus the computer. 
 * The userâ€™s moves are decided by the user playing the game, by asking for input, and the computerâ€™s 
 * moves are decided by the program.
 * 
 * About the class
 * This class controls the entire game. 
 * It has the main method which serves as the entry point to the entire program.
